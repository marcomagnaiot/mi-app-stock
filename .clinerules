# Cline's Memory Bank
Project ConstitutionThis document is the master .clinerules file. It defines the behavior, structure, and technical context that I must follow at all times. My effectiveness depends on the accuracy and clarity of this Memory Bank.My Identity and Core Directive
I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This is not a limitation; it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY AND EXCLUSIVELY on this Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL Memory Bank files at the start of EVERY task; this is not optional.Memory Bank StructureThe Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. The files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:flowchart TD

This document details the technology stack and tools used. It is the source of truth for all technical decisions.

## Frontend

-   **Framework:** React 18+
-   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+). Do not use TypeScript.
-   **Build Tool (Bundler):** Vite. The development server is started with `npm run dev`.
-   **Routing:** `react-router-dom`. This is the standard library for navigation in the application.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. **Only Tailwind classes must be used**. Do not write custom CSS in `.css` files or use `<style>` tags, unless strictly necessary for a complex animation.

## Backend and Database

-   **Service:** Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service).
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed through Supabase).
-   **Interaction:** All communication with the database and authentication is handled through the Supabase client.
-   **Supabase Client:** There is a single file at `src/supabaseClient.js` that exports the client instance. **All components must import the client from this file**.

## Environment and Deployment

-   **Package Manager:** npm. (Analogous to Composer in PHP).
-   **Version Control:** Git.
-   **Repository Hosting:** GitHub.
-   **Deployment Platform (Hosting):** Vercel. Deployment is automatic upon `git push` to the `main` branch.
-   **Environment Variables:** Secret keys (like Supabase keys) are managed in a local `.env` file and in the Vercel settings for production. They must start with the `VITE_` prefix.
Content for systemPatterns.md# System Patterns

This document defines the architecture and code design patterns that must be followed throughout the project.

## General Architecture

-   **Type:** Single Page Application (SPA).
-   **Frontend:** Built with React and Vite, it runs entirely in the client's browser.
-   **Backend:** A "Backend-as-a-Service" (BaaS) approach is used with Supabase. There is no custom backend server (like Express.js) unless explicitly decided.

## Code Patterns in React

1.  **Functional Components:** **ALL** React components must be functional components. Class components must not be used.

2.  **Hooks for State and Logic:**
    -   `useState`: To manage the local state of a component (e.g., an input's value, if a modal is open).
    -   `useEffect`: To run side effects, primarily for making API calls to Supabase when the component first loads.
    -   `useContext`: (Future use) To manage simple global state, such as authenticated user information.

3.  **File Structure:**
    -   `src/components/`: For small, reusable components (Buttons, Inputs, Cards, etc.).
    -   `src/pages/`: For components that represent an entire page (HomePage, ProductsPage, etc.).

4.  **Interaction with Supabase:**
    -   **Asynchronous Calls:** All calls to Supabase are asynchronous. `async/await` must be used.
    -   **Mandatory Error Handling:** Supabase functions return a `{ data, error }` object. It is **mandatory** to always check if `error` is not null and handle the error appropriately (showing a message to the user, logging to the console, etc.).
    -   **Data Fetching:** It is a common pattern to use a `loading` state to display an indicator while waiting for data from Supabase.

## Problem to Solve

The goal is to create an internal web application for a small business to manage product stock and record sales simply and efficiently, replacing a manual system based on spreadsheets.

## Key Features

1.  **User Authentication:** Employees must be able to register and log in to access the system.
2.  **Product Management (CRUD):**
    -   Create new products (name, price, initial stock).
    -   View a list of all products.
    -   Edit a product's information.
    -   Delete a product.
3.  **Sales Recording:** A simple interface to select a product and the quantity sold. When a sale is recorded, the corresponding product's stock must decrease automatically.
4.  **Sales History:** A page to view a list of all sales made.

## User Experience

The interface must be clean, fast, and very intuitive. Prioritize ease of use over the number of features. The application must be fully responsive to be usable from a mobile phone or tablet.

Note: When triggered by "update memory bank", I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some do not require updates. I must particularly focus on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track the current state.FINAL REMINDER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
